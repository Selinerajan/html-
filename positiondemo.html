        <h2>Logic First</h2>
        <p>This Action Kit has been made possible through the support of many committed organizations and funders, all working in partnership with the World Forum Foundation. We hope the information found here will strengthen world-wide efforts at helping the next generation grow up in a “greener” world. We know that finding ways to inspire children’s love for the earth today will help them become tomorrow’s generation of caring environmental stewards.
            Be sure to read the story of the Environmental Action Kit’s creation and the Universal Principles for Connecting the World’s Children With Nature.
            </p><p>The Global Leaders for Young Children program at the World Forum Foundation seeks to identify and develop the next generation of early childhood leaders throughout the world. This program serves as a model of expanding capacity at the country and regional levels, while building a cohesive community of international leadership to impact policy and practice worldwide.
            Purpose
            The World Forum Foundation believes that children need effective grassroots advocates. Accordingly, the Global Leader project mission statement asserts:
            
            “Global Leaders for Young Children is a World Forum Foundation project with the goal of improving life chances for young children by developing early childhood leaders who can become effective change agents and advocates for quality early childhood development in their home countries and regions.”
